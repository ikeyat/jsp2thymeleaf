A migration soluition from JSP to Thymeleaf template.
* Migration rules
* Conversion tools

# Motivation

There are a lot of existing JSP resources. However, JSP has been legacy view technology in Java.
Nowaday most developers are using other template technologies such as Thymeleaf and Freemarker.
Especially in Spring users, they love to use Thymeleaf because it provides powerful supports to Spring.
In addition, Spring Boot unrecommends to use JSP.

I suspect most people want to migrate existing JSP resources to Thyemeleaf templates.
Of course, it is impossible to migrate completely because JSP is more flexible.
But partial migration must help developers.
